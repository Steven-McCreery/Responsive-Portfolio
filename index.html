					<strong>About Me</strong>
				</h2>

				<img src="assets/images/picture.jpg" class="my_picture" alt="A Professional Picture of Myself">

				<p class="p1">
					I am someone who is driven by intellectual curiosity and the desire to maintain a high standard of excellence in my work.  I am new to the computer programming field of work but I am not new to ever-changing challenges.
				</p>

				<!-- <br /> -->

				<p class="p2">
					I have taken many branching paths that have led me to my current decision to take on the challenge of Web Development.  In my most recent job, you could say that I've been bitten by the Information Technology (IT) bug.  I had worked a few projects for a manufacturing company implementing SAP's Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tool.  There were many unique obstacles to success which necessitated innovative solutioning in order to deliver value to our internal and external customers.
				</p>

				<p class="p3">
					One notable part of my responsibilities included designing, testing, implementing, training, and supporting business users on a custom functional module that took SAP's core mechanic of delivery date determination and thoroughly enhanced many surround functionalities, even creating many new custom transaction, to enable the proactive Ship Date management methodology to our inbound product supply.  This greatly increased our teams' ability to interpret and action the outputs from Material Requirements Planning (MRP) runs.
				</p>

				<p class="p4">
					I also was the Procurement team lead in the successful implementation of this complex ERP system at one of our subsidiaries, a hydrogen fuel-cell start-up in the Boston area, in less than 100 days.
